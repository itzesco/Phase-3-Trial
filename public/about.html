            Lab Reservation System is a web-based application built specifically
            for De La Salle University students and lab technicians. The system
            streamlines the process of reserving computer lab slots across five
            different laboratories, allowing users to check real-time
            availability, manage schedules, and personalize their profiles.
            Whether you're a student needing a quiet seat to study or a lab
            technician managing daily bookings, this platform ensures a seamless
            and secure experience. With features like reservation anonymity,
            technician tools, session management, and user profiles, the system
            brings convenience and structure to lab usage on campus. By
            integrating modern web technologies, the project aims to reduce
            booking conflicts, improve lab utilization, and enhance user
            transparency through intuitive design and functionality.
